// Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results.

// You should create four lines that look like this:

// console.log(5 + 3)

// Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.

console.log(4+4);     //addition
console.log(10-2);    //subtraction
console.log(2*4);     //multiplication
console.log(16/2);    //division
